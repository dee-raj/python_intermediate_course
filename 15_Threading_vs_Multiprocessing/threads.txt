Threads: An entity within a process that can be scheduled (also known as "leightweight process")
   A process can spawn multiple threads.

Advantage:
   + All threads within a process share the same memory
   + Leightweight
   + Starting a thread is faster than starting a process
   + Great for I/O-bound tasks

Disadvantages:
   - Threading is limited bu GIL: only one thread at a time
   - No effect for CPU-bound tasks
   - Not interruptable / killable
   - Careful with race conditions
   Race conditions:
      two or more threads want to modify the same variable at the same time
