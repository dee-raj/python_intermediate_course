Process: An instance of a program (e.g. a Python interpreter)

Advantage
   + Takes advantage of multiple CPUs and cores
   + Seperate memory space -> Memory is not shared between process
   + Great for CPU-bound processing 
   + New process is started independently from other process
   + Processes are interruptable / killable 
   + One GIL for each process -> avoids GIL limitation

Disadvantages
   - Heavyweight
   - Starting a process is slower than starting a thread
   - More memory
   - IPC (inter-process communication) is more complicated
