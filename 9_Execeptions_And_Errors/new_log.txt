A feasibility study is an important step in the project planning process, 
as it helps determine whether the proposed project is practical, viable, and achievable. 
It assesses the potential risks, costs, benefits, and resources required for the successful completion of the project. 
In simplest terms, the two criteria to judge feasibility are cost required and value to be attained.
